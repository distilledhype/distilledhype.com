> Under this tab, you will see an “Add file system” link allowing you to add local file systems for editing. Directories you would like to add as a workspace require an “.allow-devtools-edit” file to be present (for now), which you can create via “touch .allow-devtools-edit” at the command-line or using your text editor of choice. When you’ve added a file system, you’ll be able to view and edit files within that directory anytime you’re working in the Sources panel.
