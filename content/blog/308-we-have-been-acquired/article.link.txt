> Since I started Distilled Hype in early 2012 I have received a lot of positive feedback from people I respect throughout the industry. But it turns out that to maintain two websites that are very similar in nature and purpose doesn't make a lot of sense, it creates extra work, splits up the audience unnecessarily and as a consequence of these to brands competing, both suffer in quality.

A merge has been made. This site has now become my personal website. You will still find interesting stuff here but the web dev stuff will be over on [TNG](http://thenittygritty.co) and we will be posting there more frequently.
