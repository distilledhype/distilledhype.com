Wow I had no idea that this was going on. Listen to the interview, amazing how much scrutiny went into making this multiple award winning game work smoothly in the browser. Which libraries did they use? What were the difficulties?

Check out the game [right here](http://www.contrejour.ie/) and play in awe as I did, once you see how well it works.

Also make sure to watch [the behind-the-scenes video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-DTW-lTbXvk).
