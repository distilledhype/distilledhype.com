A great way to organize your JavaScript code if you don't want to use an MVC framework for single page apps, or your problem doens't merit that.

I like Sparky's routing method especially:

> The best way of doing this is outputting a Controller and an Action in your head meta, but that data can be replaced with whatever you want.

It also works well together with Require.js.
