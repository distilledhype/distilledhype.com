Ok this is not very front-end dev related but, good God, this episode of The StackExchange Podcast was cracking me up! I was actually walking in the streets and sitting in the train constantly bursting into laughter. I am sure people thought I was crazy.

Besides that some interesting insights into remote working and other things.
