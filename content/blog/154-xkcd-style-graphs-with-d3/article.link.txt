> Inspired by [this blog post](http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib/) and Mike Bostock's comment [on this HN thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4597977), I decided to make an XKCD-style plot in Javascript using [D3](http://d3js.org) with a [custom interpolation function](http://bl.ocks.org/3310323).

Ooh, how much I <3 this, I can't even tell you :)
