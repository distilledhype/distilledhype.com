Yep. If you are not using a build tool yet yourself or in your team, you should start to use Yeoman now. [You can even make it work on Windows](http://www.decodize.com/css/installing-yeoman-front-end-development-stack-windows/).

Yeoman is a little monster when it comes to tools but it really makes sense to take time out and carefully inspect how you can put it to good use for yourself. You might only need a few features but it will make your life so much better.
