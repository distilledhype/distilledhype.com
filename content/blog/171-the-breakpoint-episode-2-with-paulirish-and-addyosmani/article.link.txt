> In this week's episode, +Paul Irish and I talk about new DevTools features for your SASS workflow, a ton of new hotness in the console, Inspector theming and a number of things we now support inspecting better.

Great console tips!

The music in the beginning is a little ridiculous though. It is also too long I am sure some people just stop watching because of it.

Addy has a Yeoman hoodie! I want a Grunt hoodie!

**Update:** The beginning of the video has been trimmed [says Paul](https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/264083084159381506), woohoo!
