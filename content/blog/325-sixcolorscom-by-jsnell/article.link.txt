If you follow the news around Apple a little bit you will know that Macworld recently fired a lot of really good editors.

Among them was the one Jason Snell who I know of through his brilliant podcast and podcast network [The Incomparable](theincomparable.com).

After 15 years or so at MacWorld he recently went indie with his site (link: http://sixcolors.com text: sixcolors.com).

The name of course because the original Apple logo had six colors and there is a cool story about hardcore Apple employees telling Steve Jobs after he came back that they "bleed six colors" in order to express their strong belief in Apple. What a great name for a site that largely revolves around Apple news and analysis.

I find good name choices very satisfying and this is one.

If you don't know of him yet give [Six Colors](http://sixcolors.com) or [The Incomparable](theincomparable.com) a visit!
