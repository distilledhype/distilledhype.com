As a podcast fan with ambitions of being a podcaster I have been thinking about launching my podcast for a long time.
I finally decided on a format and started production.

[DESCRIPTIVE](http://descriptive.audio) is an interview podcast with people from the JavaScript and web development world.

I am happy to announce the first episode with my very esteemed guest [Philip Roberts](http://twitter.com/philip_roberts) who is a [JSConf.eu](http://jsconf.eu) speaker and works for [&yet](http://andyet.com).

We talked about his way into development and JavaScript, as well as his JSConf.eu talk about the event loop, &yet and [AmpersandJS](http://ampersandjs.com).
