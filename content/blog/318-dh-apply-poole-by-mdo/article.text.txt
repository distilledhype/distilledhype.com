(twitter: mdo text: Mark Otto) makes nice, clean, well constructed things on the web. One of those nice things he released recently is [Poole](http://getpoole.com), a solid foundation for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) sites as well as [Lanyon](http://lanyon.poole.com) and [Hyde](http://hyde.poole.com) which are themes based on Poole. They are Open Source and released under the MIT license.

Distilled Hype's look needed a revamp since some time now. I very much appreciate Poole's simplicity, it's vertical rhythm and fantastic readability so I decided to use it. I added Hyde's sidebar but kept Poole's typography.

Since I am using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) instead of Jekyll here, I had to adjust my Kirby templates to Poole's markup. In doing so, I was able to throw out a lot of unnecessary code since Poole's markup is very simple and straight forward.

## Onward

Poole is a great new foundation for the look of Distilled Hype and even if it is not the uniquest of all designs I am happy with it for now. Maybe I'll manage to make it my own with a few tweaks over time.
