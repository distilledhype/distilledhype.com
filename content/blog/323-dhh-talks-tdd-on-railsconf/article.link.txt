I have never practiced TDD but I watched this talk anyway because it's always great to see DHH talk! What he says about TDD makes a lot of sense to me. I love his perspective on programming because it mirrors mine pretty well.

There is always a lot to learn about giving talks from DHH as well. Note how well his story is constructed and how easy it seems for him to make very clear points. Definitly worth a watch.
