When I first saw the title of that post I was like: "Oh noes! Smashing Magazine is link-baiting, the world is going to end!!!".

But then I say the post and it is awesome. It literally features the best and most useful libs and jQuery plugins that have emerged this year. As a web developer you have to bookmark this article because chances are you might not only need one but multiple of these in your work.
