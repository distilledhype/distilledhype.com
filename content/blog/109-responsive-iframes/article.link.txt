Text: > Our library targets a challenging use-case in which embedded content:
>
> * Can have unknown width and height
> * Can have unknown width/height ratio
> * Can change its width or height as users interact with dynamic content and we want the size of the IFrame to change accordingly to avoid scrollbars.

NPR made a small jQuery plugin to deal with that.
