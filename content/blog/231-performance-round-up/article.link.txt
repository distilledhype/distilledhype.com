> I've recently seen apps whose performance is being crushed by large & expensive paints, extra layouts, bad event decoupling or too many network requests. They are all fixable items, and Chrome's DevTools and tracing tool both do a great job of showing you what's going on under the hood.

Paul Lewis from Google put together all that important performance stuff that came up by the end of last year. Awesome.
