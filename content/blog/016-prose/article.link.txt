Text: > Prose is a web-based interface for managing text-based content in your GitHub repositories. Use it to create, edit, and delete files, and save your changes directly to GitHub.
>
> Prose is great for making quick updates to your code or managing your blog. Prose pays special attention to Jekyll sites hosted on GitHub Pages with Markdown text preview and syntax reference. 

A really beautiful way to edit your pages in Github, so if you have a Jekyll site that is hosted there, this seems to be the best way to make quick updates. I really dig the design and the code/markdown highlighting they do.
