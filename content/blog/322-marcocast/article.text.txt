As an avid podcast listener and a fan of [Marco Arment](http://marco.org) and his work, I was very interested in his newest release, a podcast app for iPhone called [Overcast](http://overcast.fm).

After taking a look at the app, I am really impressed, although not surprised, with the amount of thought that went into creating this app.

A few stand out features that make it useful are:

* The Smart Speed feature which is genius, and so far nobody else seems to have thought of yet, "dynamically shortens silences in talk shows".
* The Smarter Playlist feature allows you to prioritise podcasts and new episodes will play accordingly.
* There are multiple discovery features but the one I find most useful is the one that suggests podcasts from your Twitter followers.
* There is a section in the settings view in which Marco links to his (indie) competitors in case you don't like his app. (So classy!)

The features listed above that Marco has implemented in Overcast are indicative of the thoughtfulness of his work and is one of the reasons I have been listening to Marco on podcasts for years now.

I have grown to appreciate his thoroughness, be it in the software he develops, his writing, and speaking on podcasts. The same care is also evident in his newest work.

Even though I highly recommend Overcast, I deleted it from my phone a few hours after installing it. The reason I deleted it is because I have an iPhone 4S and support for iOS 7 will be discontinued as soon as iOS 8 is out. I expect iOS 8 to perform very poorly on the iPhone 4S and I don't plan on installing iOS 8. Therefore, Overcast is not the best option for me. I am also very happy with my current app, [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/android/pocketcasts).

If you are looking for a podcast app I highly recommend both Pocket Casts and Overcast.
