Text: Bigups to the Grunt team for shipping v0.4.0! I also really like some of the stuff coming up in the Grunt Roadmap for v0.5.0:

> Grunt v0.5 will ship with support for a new plugin format called node-task. It defines a stateless, promise-based, event emitting API that doesn’t depend on Grunt. It has a real-live spec, and the Grunt team is working with the front-end developer community in the hopes that compliant modules will be compatible with every task runner under the sun. When it’s done, it will ship with a test suite that anyone can use to build their own tasks.
