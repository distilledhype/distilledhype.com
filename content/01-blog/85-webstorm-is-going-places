Text: WebStorm is really evolving very fast. They are doing some awesome stuff and manage to keep up with developments in front-end development. Pretty impressive

A note on Paul's Google+ account:

I guess since Paul is working at Google, his primary outlet is his Google+ account. He is posting links and reposting other peoples posts and starts discussions on a regular basis over there. It is mostly very high level but very interesting. You also find the work of other awesome peeps in his stream.
