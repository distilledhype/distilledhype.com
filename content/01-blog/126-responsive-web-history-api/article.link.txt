Text: > This talk is about about how GitHub handles links, the url bar, partial page updates, and explains why I think the HTML5 history API is the most important thing to happen to front end development since Firebug.

Very interesting insights by Kyle Neath who is a designer at Github, even though it would be awesome to have at least the audio of that talk!

Also check out [Kyle's blog](http://warpspire.com/) it has a really nice and clean look that reminds very much of Githubs design and of course a lot of insightful blog posts.
