> Better JavaScript language definition for TextMate and SublimeText2. This builds on the language files commonly used and adds more fine grained matching and also includes new features from ECMAScript 6 like modules, succinct methods, arrow functions, classes, and accessors (ES5).

Great for programming for Node.js or any JavaScript for that matter since you get improved highlighting of the variables. See the comparison [here](https://img.skitch.com/20121019-qa5tjrcq4rr69gmend2jans8h3.png).
