>  I get the reasons why face time is important. This is why even companies that are advocates of remote work, like Github and 37signals, have company-wide meetups at least once a year. Even an arrangement where a dev can come in once a week, or when needed during crunch time for a project or a special planning meeting, seems reasonable. But I don't see a reason why, in 2013, given the tools we have, a developer has to be on-site at a desk every day, as the normal operating procedure.  Think of how many times companies miss out on really good developers just because they're not open to remote workers.

Agreed.
