Finally the Coyier officially launches CodePen. What I like about it compared to JSFiddle is that it comes with LESS, SASS and CoffeeScript out of the box. By the by if you like his work check out [his Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/150422311/screencasting-a-complete-redesign) which has exceeded it's goal very quickly.
