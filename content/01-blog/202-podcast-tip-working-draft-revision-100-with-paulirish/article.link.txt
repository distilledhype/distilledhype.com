> Wow, can it really be the 100th episode already? Almost 2 years of weekly updates and discussions on web development – and we’re still here. And so no one less than Paul Irish joined Hans, Kahlil, Rodney and Schepp. While our podcast is a German thing, we’re thrilled how things turned out with recording an English episode over the wire. Thank you Paul!

It was great to have Paul on he had some interesting insights to share aswell.
