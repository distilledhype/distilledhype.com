> Once you know where to go you need to break down the feature you want to add into very little bricks. Each brick needs to be the smallest possible : one or two (unit or integration) tests to add to describe the brick, and the corresponding one or two methods to write (or change) to make them pass.
Group the bricks by dependence from one to another, if you have 10 bricks to do, with about 10 to 20 tests and methods to write and all them are "dependent" upon one another you might have to go back to the white board and think again.

Great tips on how to work with Git.
