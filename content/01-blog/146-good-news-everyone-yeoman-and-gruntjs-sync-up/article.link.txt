> * yeoman will be upstreaming a few solo tasks into grunt-contrib (or at least, work with tkellen on figuring how best to do that).. tasks like img, misc, manifest
> * yeoman will upstream our generators setup (inspired by rails) into the grunt init implementation. ben's expressed interest in this for a while and we think we can share this code and all be happy here.
> * we'll first start with a design doc for everyone to review, and we'll continue the above two items with regular checks between yeoman and grunt folks.
> * we really want yeoman to play well within the grunt ecosystem and are focused on delivering a great end UX while still benefiting the larger community beyond our direct users.
> * we've actually brought on sindre as a contractor to devote dedicated time to this upstreaming effort

This is very good news. Also great to see that Sindre is getting hired to work on this! w00t!!1!
