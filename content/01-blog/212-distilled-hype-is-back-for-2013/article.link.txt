I've had a few of problems keeping up the frequency here last year. Well, there is no excuse for that and I apologize. I am glad to say though, that I was able to launch two side-projects by the end of last year.

One of them is the [new Agent Lexie site](http://agentlexie.com) which took an awfully long time to complete, like a year or so. But hey I think the result is pretty rad and it is a great platform for us to finally release the tracks of the upcoming album. Check out the latest release [Gorilla](http://blog.agentlexie.com/post/36235282024/gorilla) there is more to come shortly.

The other was [The Nitty Gritty](http://thenittygritty.co) which I created together with @[drublic](http://twitter.com/drublic). A place for wicked articles on web development. Anybody can [contribute](http://thenittygritty.co/contribute). We had a great start with an article on [Modular CSS](http://thenittygritty.co/decouple-css) by @[drublic](http://twitter.com/drublic) and an extensive article on [CSS Masks](http://thenittygritty.co/css-masking) by @[derSchepp](http://twitter.com/derSchepp).

The response so far has been great. It seems like it really pays off for all parties to create a focused entity online to publish articles on a certain subject instead of having them scattered all over the net on personal blogs. I am excited about the results and I am looking forward to continue this project in 2013.

Now I said in the headline that Distilled Hype is now even more dangerous. Why? First of all I am going to work hard on doing a better job on the post frequency. Also I am planning on implememnting a few changes that might help support the work I am doing over here.

Thank you for reading Distilled Hype! It means a lot to me that you guys enjoy this site and come back to check it out on a regular basis.

You are hereby declared **fkn awsm**! (If you want a sticker for your latptop say **fk yeh**!)
