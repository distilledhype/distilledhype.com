title: Issue 004: Mostly videos

----

text: I am trying to bring the posting schedule up to once a week. I like that kind of rhythm for this publication. That will make the link list per shorter per issue but I don't think that is a problem. 

This issue I have a whole bunch of videos for you, as well as a podcast recommendation and a usefull jQuery link… Enjoy! 

### [FluentConf Videos &rarr;](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=PL75AC4484E6866741)
The Fluentconf videos. Most of them are really short and filled to the brim with good infos. I enjoyed [Paul Irish’s talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7AU2Ozu8eo&list=PL75AC4484E6866741&index=10&feature=plpp_video), [Nicole Sullivan's talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulNSlES1Fds&list=PL75AC4484E6866741&index=1&feature=plpp_video), [Leah Verou’s talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T57Ivn5-Pw&list=PL75AC4484E6866741&index=13&feature=plpp_video) and [Gary Flake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5dJVfipkhY&list=PL75AC4484E6866741&index=12&feature=plpp_video)'s talk about Bookmarklets.

### [The State of Backbone &rarr;](http://blog.documentcloud.org/blog/2012/06/state-of-the-backbone/)
Backbone’s creator talks about the state of Backbone. 

### [jQuery++ &rarr;](http://jquerypp.com/)
> I’m all about providing low-level utilities for things that jQuery doesn’t support.

A sensible collection of extensions to jQuery. Very clever and really useful aswell.

### [Kalzumeus podcast episode 2 &rarr;](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/05/18/kalzumeus-podcast-ep-2-with-amy-hoy-pricing-products-and-passion/)
This episode of the Kalzumeus podcast feat. Amy Hoy has been mentioned quite a bit on Twitter so I had to checked it out. It’s a great episode basically surrounding the topic of „doing your own thing“. It will get you off you arse!

### [Watch Dogs &rarr;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=FcMRkyoHKeA)
Ubisoft’s upcoming game Watch Dogs. It looks stunning and the idea is pretty compelling. 

### [CLANG! &rarr;](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang)
I got this of @[gruber](http://twitter.com/gruber)’s [page](http://daringfireball.net). He said: 
> Watch the video, trust me.

He was right. 

### [Muleradio.net &rarr;](http://muleradio.net/)
This is @[Mike_FTW](http://twitter.com/Mike_FTW)’s pocast network. I love the design of their website.
