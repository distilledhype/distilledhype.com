Text: >Today, a cross-vendor collection of developers, led by Google, is open-sourcing RoboHornet. As project lead Alex Komoroske put it, “it’s a living, dynamic benchmark that aims to use the collective efforts of the web development community and ultimately get browser vendors to fix real-world performance pain points.” Let’s look at how RoboHornet will hopefully flip the above situation on its head.
>
> 1. Web app developers identify and isolate a specific pain point in their app
> 2. That issue is reduced down to a solid benchmark
> 3. Propose it to a committee of JavaScript experts from JSPerf, YUI, Google, Facebook, and others
> 4. Everyone votes for which issues should make it
> 5. Of the top voted items, as long as the committee thinks they are good, they head into the benchmark
> 6. The RoboHornet Suite now better represents the web app developer communities biggest priorities for performance
> 7. Browser vendors compete on their RoboHornet score, optimizing the slow behaviors that developers prioritize
> 8. Everybody wins. Yay ice cream for everyone!

Yay ice cream! ... and also way to innovate on benchmarking and finding the REAL pain points in browsers. Also read [Jeremy Keith's post on the subject](http://adactio.com/journal/5778/).
