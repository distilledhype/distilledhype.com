If you didn't know: I am a huge Gist and Gist API fan. So I am soo happy about the new re-written version of it. Long awaited features come with the new rewrite like:

> You can now view the full history of every Gist, complete with diffs. Never be blamed for sloppy coding again.

And

> The new Gist tells you which forks have activity, making it easier to find interesting changes from coworkers or complete strangers.
