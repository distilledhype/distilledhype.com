Text: Addy just recently updated [his Backbone Fundamentals book](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals) with a section on how to get started with [Bocoup's Backbone Boilerplate](http://weblog.bocoup.com/introducing-the-backbone-boilerplate/) and [grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb).

Sweet!
