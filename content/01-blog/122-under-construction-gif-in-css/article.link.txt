Text: On the h5bp lazy web requests Paul requested a classic Gif of a working man to be modernized:

> This is a classic piece of the web. But we really need to upgrade him to the modern day. I'm talking a pure CSS version of this.

And within 60 minutes [joshnh](https://github.com/joshnh) delivered this single html-element-tons-of-css-backgrounds version which weighs 60k after minification and 3k after Gzip!

Sick!!!
