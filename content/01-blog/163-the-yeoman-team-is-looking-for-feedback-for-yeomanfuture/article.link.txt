> `yeoman init backbone` will become `yeoman backbone`. The main difference is that we'll now create everything statically up front, by that I mean, the generators job is to scaffold out the project with Gruntfile (with generator specific tasks), package.json and every dependency you need based on some prompts. Then it's grunt's job to handle the task execution. This will make your project 100% grunt compatible and remove the need for the hidden magic. Everything about how it works will be visible in the Gruntfile and you'll be able to change whatever you want, add tasks, etc. This is a HUGE win! Our generators will add in the tasks it needs as dependencies, but users are free to change those.

This is fantastic news, I believe it is the absolutely the right decision.

Please help the Yeoman team by letting them know what you think!
