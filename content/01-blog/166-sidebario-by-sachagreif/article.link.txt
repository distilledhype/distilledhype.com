> The 5 best design links, every day.

Mr. Sacha "Side-Project" Greif strikes again! This time he built a little curated design-links service with [Meteor](http://meteor.com), rumor has it that there will be an open source release following.

You can also receive the linkings via newsletter. I like it, the only thing missing for my taste is a little bit of context from the curators to better understand why they personally linked to something.
