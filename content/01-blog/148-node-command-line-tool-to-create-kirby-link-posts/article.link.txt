As you may know I am maintaining this link blog with the file based [Kirby CMS](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms). In order to create a post I have to create a folder named with the slug of the post prefixed by a number for sorting the posts.

In that folder I have to create a file called `article.link.txt` and in that text file I use a certain template where title, link and text has it's own place. As discribed in [this tutorial](http://getkirby.com/blog/custom-post-types).

Since it was a little tiresome for me to create a folder and file for everypost I automated it with Node.

Now I just have to call `klp 'Title of post' http://externallink.com` to automatically create folder, file and fill in title and link in the right place, plus it opens the file automatically in Sublime for editing.

Boom.

Feel free to extend it's functionality if you use Kirby aswell.
