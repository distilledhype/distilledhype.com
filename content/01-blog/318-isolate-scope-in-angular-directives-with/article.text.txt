Today at work I needed to isolate scope in a directive in an Angular because I was ng-repeating a directive and passing in an attribute for each directive. I didn't need it before and I always found directives very hard to understand. So finally I had to take some time out in order to dive in to what is going on here.

After a few short egghead.io video tutorials I finally understood what was going on.
