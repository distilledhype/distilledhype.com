A while ago I listened to (link: http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/24/ text: an episode of the New Disruptors podcast) with (twitter: GlennF text: @GlennF). He was interviewing Cory Doctorow of the BoingBoing. Glenn asked him how he managed to be so productive and Cory's answers were two-fold and kind of inspiring to me. 

1. Say "no" to many things, so you can concentrate on what you are doing right now and nothing else. And
2. He wrote in any free minute he could get while he was working a demanding day job. 

He also believes in writing a specific word-count every day. Set a word count that is not too challenging and meet that count everyday. Stop at that word count. Don't go over it and the best thing is to stop in the middle of a sentence because it is much easier to continue the trail of thought on the the next day. 

I am not a writer. I never was and I have no ambitions to be one. But I am craving an output and that exercise of meeting a specific word count everyday is appealing to me. 

I am currently still struggling to achieve a consistent output of links over on (link: http://thenittygritty.co text: The Nitty Gritty). So I thought to myself, what is a consistent daily rate that I can realistically achieve? 

I came up with this: one link a day. \o/

I started two days ago and so far it has been going very well :D I even over performed by exactly one link every day. 

Maybe two is the magic number? We'll see.
