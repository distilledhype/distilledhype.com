> Tekpub's Rob Conery and Marionette's Derick Bailey joined up to record a screencast on migrating an existing Backbone.js application to Marionette. The result has been released as a free episode to help you better understand how you can begin using Marionette today, without having to re-write your app from scratch.

Sweet!
