Text: > JavaScript developers have been accustomed to a very scattered and incoherent API (the DOM) for some time. As a result, some of JavaScript’s most common patterns are pretty weird and unnecessary when programming for a unified and coherent API like Node. It can be easy to forget that the entire ES5 specification is available to you, but there are some standard patterns that deserve to be rethought because of ES5’s newer features.

It looks like DailyJS is starting up a new series about how to best write JavaScript for Node.js. It's a good reminder and intro into the newer JavaScript features which can be easily forgotten if you only write for the DOM.
