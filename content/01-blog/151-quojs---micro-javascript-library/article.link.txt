> QuoJS is a micro, modular, Object-Oriented and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and Ajax interactions for rapid mobile web development. It allows you to write powerful, flexible and cross-browser code with its elegant, well documented, and micro coherent API.

This looks pretty interesting. Remember: on a mobile phone [jQuery takes 0.3 seconds _just to get parsed_](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/lazy-evaluation-of-commonjs-modules/), you are definitely doing good in looking for alternatives like this. Also see [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com).
