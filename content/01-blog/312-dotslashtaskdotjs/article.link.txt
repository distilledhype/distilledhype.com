(twitter:substack) (link: http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run text:has been very vocal) about his opinion on JavaScript task runners like Grunt or Gulp.

To emphasize his point further he created a new task runner called `./task.js` which does exactly what he describes in his `npm run` post but completely without using npm or bash scripts.

> * not cross-platformant for deploying to windows server 2003
> * old news. Nobody uses bash these days.

I am guessing he got a lot of feedback about how many people just don't want to deal with bash scripts.

The post is very funny.

> `./task.js` provides the structure, order, and authority that you as a developer so desperately crave.

For context: In (link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCQNm6yiZh0#t=616 text:this talk) he states that npm works because anarchy works. Which is a weird thing to say since npm is a centralized system with strict rules and conventions.

Anyway, it's entertaining on one hand but also very interesting for me personally on the other hand, to learn how easy it is to set up your build tasks without a build tool and just simple pure JS and node modules.

I still believe the abstraction we get in Gulp and Grunt useful in many ways. Especially when you work in teams of developers of different calibers.

Maybe, because of how deep substacks knowledge and ability is in this field, he might miss the point of how tools like Gulp and Grunt make so many developers lives so much better and how they create an entry point to build automation for people with less knowledge about Node and programming.
