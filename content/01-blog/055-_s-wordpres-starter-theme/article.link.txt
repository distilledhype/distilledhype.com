On the [Shoptalk Show Episode with Matt Mullenweg](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/031-with-matt-mullenweg/), Matt mentioned this starter theme. It seems to be the ultimate starting point for Wordpress Themes also you can contribute to the code on Github. If you do that, your face will show up on the bottom of the page with your number of commits to the project.
