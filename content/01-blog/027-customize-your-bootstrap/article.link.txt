Totally agree with this. Really getting tired of every new app sporting the bootstrap look.

Fortunately [Antonin Januska](http://antjanus.com/blog/author/antjanus/) over here wrote up a blog post on how to quickly and easily customize your Bootstrap app!
He also provided a list of positive examples. Great links!

Thank you Antonin.
