Text: I already watched the Backbone one which was awesome. I am hearing good things about @[brianmoschel](http://twitter.com/brianmoschel)'s Can.js presentaion as well.

I like the thing they do on Infoq.com where the slide changes get triggerd by the video. That's how it should be. The Infoq site otherwise looks pretty trashy... Well, I take function over form in this case I guess ;)

[Throne Of JS](http://throneofjs.com/) site looks mega-awesome though! Reminds me of [something I posted earlier today](/blog/samurai) :)
