Text: Ben is raising some very interesting concerns here. This one I find the potentially most disrupting:

> Only I know where grunt is going, if at all. Grunt is super-duper-pre-1.0 and might still change substantially before 1.0. It's probably going to be difficult and impractical to build a wrapper tool around a still-very-much-changing tool like grunt. What's the time delay between a new version of grunt being released and the wrapper tool incorporating those changes?

On top of that you have confused developers that don't know where to turn for issues. Is it a grunt bug or a Yeoman bug? What is the sane solution?
