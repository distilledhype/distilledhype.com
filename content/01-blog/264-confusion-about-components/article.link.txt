> This situation is made more confusing because neither project addresses this fact. It’s almost like they don’t want to acknowledge each other. There’s a discussion about Bower in the component Google Group, but neither project is particularly helpful with regard to the differences between manifest files, given the decision to use the same name.

Well, no, because Bower can be configured to use a different file name, and the projects have different goals. However, the clash is unfortunate, particularly for client-side developers who work closer to the design end of the design/coding spectrum, and may not even be aware that both projects exist.

After this article was published Sindre Sorhus [responded with links to two Github issues](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/295927807152902144) that actually discuss the above mentioned issue.
