If you haven't seen it yet, you have to go see Django Unchained. I absolutely love this movie and I was positively floored by the performances of Christoph Waltz, Leo DiCaprio and Sam Jackson as well as the power of some of the scenes of that movie.

Terry Gross had both, Christop Waltz and Quentin Tarantino, on different episodes of her NPR show Fresh Air. I highly recommend you listen to [both](http://www.npr.org/2012/12/18/167062665/unchained-admiration-between-actor-and-director) of [them](http://www.npr.org/2013/01/02/168200139/quentin-tarantino-unchained-and-unruly).
