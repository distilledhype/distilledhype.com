Text: Sam is the founder of [Nothing Magical](http://nothingmagical.com/) and the developer behind [Cheddar](http://twitter.com/cheddar). You can find out basically everything about him on episode [38](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38) and [39](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/39) of [Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/).

He was so kind to share his Sublime Text 2 config on Gist. I love to see other dev's config files because there is always one or two things that you didn't know about.

For instace this very useful property:

    "folder_exclude_patterns": [
        ".git",
        ".sass-cache",
        "coverage",
        "log",
        "tmp"
    ]
