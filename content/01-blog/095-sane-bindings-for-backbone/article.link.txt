Text: > Stickit differs, however, in that it is a more natural fit with Backbone's style and functionality. In Backbone fashion, stickit leaves rendering up to you, with no special attributes, configuration, or markup needed in the DOM; in fact, stickit will probably clean up your templates, as you will need to interpolate fewer variables while rendering.

Sweet.
