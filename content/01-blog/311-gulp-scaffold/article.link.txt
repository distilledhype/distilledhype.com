Yesterday I sent (link:https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-template/pull/3 text:this PR) for (link:https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-template text:gulp-template) which bloated up the Gulp plugin unnecessarily. I wanted to parse cli options and send that as data to the templating function. Sindre rejected that plugin and rightly so, since you can do what I wanted to do by just (link:https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-template/pull/3#issuecomment-31743866 text:requiring a node module in the gulp-template call).

That blew my mind.

Here a bullet list of my thoughts right then:

* wow.
* such effortless.
* very elegance.
* much simple.

So I created the gulp-scaffold repo to document what I learned and maybe even collect some more scaffolding ideas.
