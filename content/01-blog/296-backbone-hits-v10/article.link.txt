> Jeremy Ashkenas has just announced that Backbone.js 1.0 has been released, after a whole year on the 0.9 branch. This release adds support for HTTP PATCH requests, where partial updates are sent to the server. It also provides some sugar for data filtering methods like where and omit (from Underscore.js). Jeremy also notes that the annotated source has been improved.
