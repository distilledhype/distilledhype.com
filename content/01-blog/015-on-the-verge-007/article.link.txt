Man, I love this show. I am still in shock about how well it is produced plus in this episode Geordi La Forge is on... 

In related news The Verge is putting together a daily [90 Seconds On The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/25/3117435/90-seconds-on-the-verge-nokia-microsoft-nexus) video series. Again, the camera work and set design for it, is done amazingly well.
