And right after sitting through Siracusa's 2 hour analysis you should listen to Marco rip through the API announcement again. This one is very funny as well as informative. One thing I found especially interesting: he says that he thinks that Twitter already is profitable but needs to try to be insanely profitable in order to provide good returns for their investors.

> Twitter does not have to make money. Twitter already is making money, they're making **tons** of money.
> Most people don't realize that. [...] From what we know [...] all indications point to Twitter is already profitable and from what I understand they are very profitable. [...] Before their douchy announcement they're already profitable.
