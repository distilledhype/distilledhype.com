At work we have to log hours in a web interface. It can feel tedious to log the hours in a web form especially when you have to log multiple things a day and you are cmd+tabbing between editor and terminal all the time. I wanted to have a command line tool that allows me to quickly log things into a text file in my Dropbox. I could not find one that was as simple as I wanted it to be, so I made one. I wrote it in Node, naturally, and it is called [worklog](http://github.com/distilledhype/node-worklog).

Now I can just type in `worklog -m 'wow. such work. very logging.'` in the terminal and quickly move on to other stuff. That little message then will be logged in my Dropbox folder in a directory called "worklog" in a file that has the current date as a name. The message is prefixed with a time stamp so I know at what time I logged that work.

For me it's a great way to document work. Try it out if you like, it's on npm.

Just `npm install -g worklog` it.
