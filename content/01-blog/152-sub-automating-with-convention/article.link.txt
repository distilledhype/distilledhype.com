> 37 works in a deceptively simply manner: an executable (`bin/37`) parses out subcommands, which map to a single script in the repoâ€™s `libexec/` directory. This gave convention to our scrappy outfit of battle-hardened shell scripts. No longer were they to be randomly named misfits! They each now were subcommands of 37, organized and named by a convention of `libexec/37-SUBCOMMAND`.

THIS. IS. AWESOME.
