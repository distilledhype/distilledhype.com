title: Episode 001: A fresh start

----

text: _Die illsten Links von neulich_ was a series of posts [on my blog](http://kahlil.co) and a newsletter. Which I decided to discontinues due to time restrictions and doubt in the usefulness of that series.

After a couple of months I received a bunch of inquiries about when the next issue will come. That was when I realized I had successfully linked myself into the hearts of my (4 to 5) readers. 

So now the series starts fresh with its own website, built with the fantastic [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) and Twitter Bootstrap. And the best thing: The links are now available in German and English.

You can also subscribe to the newsletter which is re-activated and can be found [over here](/en/newsletter).

Hopefully you've prepared some great coffee… Because these hyperlinks are enjoyed best  in the morning with a hot cup of that delicious dark brew!

So, here goes:

### [Svbtle &rarr;](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle)
> A couple of months ago, after being irritated by the complexity and uninspiring nature of most blogging platforms, […]

Dustin Curtis created an alternative to the existing blogging platforms because he was frustrated about them. He names it *Svbtle*. The platform is not Open Source but was copied by [some guy to Hacker News](http://natewienert.com/codename-obtvse) right after it was published, which [caused a discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3744237) about copyright on design.<br>
Anyway, Svbtle still is an interesting project - apart from the fact that nearly noone can be part of it. You can apply [here](http://svbtle.com/apply) to get in though. And if you got great skills as a writer you may become part of the community.<br>
Another interesting point is the fact that the platform provides a data check like it is done in professional journalism.


### [Git Legit &rarr;](http://www.git-legit.org/)
> Legit is a complementary command-line interface for Git, optimized for workflow simplicity. It is heavily inspired by GitHub for Mac.

A shot on simplifying git commands.

> Grunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.

*Grunt* is a nice build tool by Ben Alman (@[cowboy](http://twitter.com/cowboy)) working for @[bocoup](http://twitter.com/bocoup).<br>
Because of his thorough programming and a solid API *Grunt* is extendable by every module out there. This makes it to one of the build tools which may become a de-facto standard for Node.js and front-end development.


### [Backbone Boilerplate &rarr;](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate)
> Existing boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very prescriptive; this boilerplate changes that.

Bocoup's Backbone Boilerplate uses Require.js and Grunt and is one of the best Backbone.js boilerplates so far.

### [Multi-Device Layout Patterns &rarr;](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514)

LukeW is the thinktank behind the "Mobile First" approach. He tries to summarize useful patterns and best practices on responsive layouts.

>I combed through all the examples curated on the Media Queries gallery site several times. I looked for what high-level patterns showed up most frequently and tried to avoid defining separate patterns where there were only small differences.


### [Rails.app &rarr;](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397300529/railsapp)
> Enough is enough. We need a way to get up and running with Rails that is as conventional and pleasant as Rails itself.

To get Ruby on Rails running if you are a beginner was pretty easy in the past. Today this has changed. But luckily Yahuda Katz, Ruby on Rails maintainer and co-creator of Ember.js is trying to get back the easy installation of the past. That's why he took his project *Rails.app* on Kickstarter and asks for help. The goal of $25.000 is already reached and thus the project will be developed \o/.

Personally I am happy about this project and tensed to see how Rails.app will work.


### [Subtle Sans →](http://www.subtlepatterns.com/subtlesans/)

> Foresight.js gives webpages the ability to tell if the user's device is capable of viewing high-resolution images (such as the 3rd generation iPad) before the image is requested from the server.

A solid solution to the problem of delivering images to devices like the new iPad. Convincing library.
