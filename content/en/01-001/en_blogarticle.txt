title: Issue 001: A fresh start

----

text: _Die illsten Links von neulich_ was a series of German posts [on my blog](http://kahlil.co) and a newsletter that distilled the latest high quality links in front-end development and general geekery from the the big river of information passing through in recent weeks and lists them with a little commentary. I decided to discontinue that series due to time restrictions and doubts in it's usefulness.

After a couple of months I received a bunch of inquiries about when the next issue will come. That was when I realized I had successfully hyperlinked myself into the hearts of my (4 to 5) readers.

So now the series starts fresh with its own website, built with the fantastic [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) and Twitter Bootstrap. But the biggest improvement must be, that they will be in English and German from now on, thanks to the help of [Hans](http://drublic.de).
You can also subscribe to the newsletter which is re-activated and can be found [over here](/en/newsletter).

Hopefully you've prepared some great coffee… Because these hyperlinks are enjoyed best  in the morning with a hot cup of that delicious dark brew!

So here goes:

If the browser does not support the requested features the API intellegently suggests other browsers to the user based on the device and the OS she is using.

With one of his tweets my friend [André Ruffert](http://twitter.com/andreruffert) reminded me, that it's possible to measure the time it takes to run some JavaScript code with the Chrome Dev Tools. A nice feature that is not very well known.

### [Svbtle &rarr;](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle)
> A couple of months ago, after being irritated by the complexity and uninspiring nature of most blogging platforms, […]

Dustin Curtis created an alternative to the existing blogging platforms because he was frustrated with them. He named it *Svbtle*. The platform is not Open Source but was copied by [some guy to Hacker News](http://natewienert.com/codename-obtvse) right after it was published, which [stirred up a discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3744237) about copyright on design.<br>
Anyway, Svbtle is an interesting project - apart from the fact that nearly noone can be part of it. You can apply [here](http://svbtle.com/apply) to get in though. And if you can prove that you are a great writer you may become part of the community.<br>
Another interesting point is the fact that the platform provides a fact-checking and editing service like it should be done in professional journalism.

### [Git Legit &rarr;](http://www.git-legit.org/)
> Legit is a complementary command-line interface for Git, optimized for workflow simplicity. It is heavily inspired by GitHub for Mac.

### [Grunt &rarr;](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt)
> Grunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.

*Grunt* is a nice build tool by Ben Alman (@[cowboy](http://twitter.com/cowboy)) who works for @[bocoup](http://twitter.com/bocoup).<br>
Because of his thorough programming and a solid API *Grunt* is extendable by every module out there. This makes it one of the build tools which may become a de-facto standard for Node.js and front-end development.

### [Backbone Boilerplate &rarr;](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate)
> Existing boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very prescriptive; this boilerplate changes that.

Bocoup's Backbone Boilerplate uses Require.js and Grunt and is one of the best Backbone.js boilerplates so far.

### [Multi-Device Layout Patterns &rarr;](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514)

LukeW is the thinktank behind the "Mobile First" approach. He tries to summarize useful patterns and best practices on responsive layouts.

> I combed through all the examples curated on the Media Queries gallery site several times. I looked for what high-level patterns showed up most frequently and tried to avoid defining separate patterns where there were only small differences.


### [Rails.app &rarr;](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397300529/railsapp)
> Enough is enough. We need a way to get up and running with Rails that is as conventional and pleasant as Rails itself.

To get Ruby on Rails up and running as a beginner was pretty easy in the past. Today, not so much. But luckily Yahuda Katz, Ruby on Rails maintainer and co-creator of Ember.js is trying to get back to the easy installation of the past. That's why he pledged for support for his project *Rails.app* on Kickstarter. The goal of $25.000 was exceeded very fast and thus the project will definitely be implemented \o/.

Personally I am excited to see how it will come out.


### [Subtle Sans →](http://www.subtlepatterns.com/subtlesans/)

Great Font. For free. Nuff said.

### [The Industry →](http://theindustry.cc)
> The Industry brings a new voice to tech media. Highlighting design focused startups and people, we exist to give the design community a voice in the tech industry.

### [Startups, this is how design works →](http://startupsthisishowdesignworks.com/)
> But what is ‘design’ actually? Is it a logo? A Wordpress theme? An innovative UI?

A website that discusses the principles of a good design and how it matters for startups.

### [Foresight.js →](https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js)
> Foresight.js gives webpages the ability to tell if the user's device is capable of viewing high-resolution images (such as the 3rd generation iPad) before the image is requested from the server.

A solid solution to the problem of delivering images to devices like the new iPad.


### [Game Of Thrones Season 2 →](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVkr9oYsIbo)
> Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.

One of the best TV shows on the planet returns with season 2.

### [JS Resources →](http://wijmo.com/javascript-programming-resources/)
> If you are a C# (or any Object-oriented language) programmer looking to learn patterns and practices in JavaScript then these resources are great for inspiration and instruction. If you are already a JavaScript programmer I guarantee that there are things you can learn from the style guides. I am still learning from them.

Another list of great JavaScript resources.

### [If Twitter was invented in the 80s &rarr;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=FCvidD5JKBg#!)

### [JSConf EU Datum &rarr;](https://twitter.com/#!/jsconfeu/status/187448254835863552)
> Berlin. October 6th–7th (+/-2).

Save the date(-range ;).

### [EMBLR &rarr;](http://emberjs.tumblr.com/)
> EMBLR, THE EMBER.JS TUMBLR

Ember.js, the MV* framework by Yehude Katz, is gaining traction.
I think Ember's opinionated approach, that was inspired by Ruby on Rails, is working.

From [emberjs.com](http://emberjs.com):
> Ember is a JavaScript framework for creating ambitious web applications that eliminates boilerplate and provides a standard application architecture.

The path to get a complex JavaScript project up and running is shorter with Ember than other libs, since you don't have to make so many decisions by yourself and you can just concentrate on building your app. Backbone.js requires a boilerplate or making your own decisions about architecture and templating.

Paul Irish created a Tumblr blog that collects links about Ember.js. A great idea. Somebody should do that for Backbone.js aswell.
